 🌌 3D Solar System Simulation

An interactive **3D visualization of the solar system** built using **Three.js**, allowing users to explore planets, view their orbits, and click on them for detailed information.

 🚀 Features

✅ **Realistic planetary orbits** with textures.  
✅ **Smooth camera controls** using OrbitControls.  
✅ **Clickable planets** that display key information.  
✅ **dat.GUI integration** to adjust settings like speed and orbit visibility.  
✅ **Raycasting interactions** for immersive user experience.  

 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Three.js** – For rendering 3D models.
- **OrbitControls** – For camera movement.
- **dat.GUI** – For real-time settings adjustments.
- **WebGLRenderer** – For high-performance rendering.
